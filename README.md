This is where you can put how much you want to deposit and it will deposit it . 


I have created a smart contract and complete dapp where one can deposit their ETH and earn interest on it , depening upon the time periods of their duration . 

I used: 
Solidity 
Hardhat
React.js
Javascript
Css
Chai(for testing)
Infura (get api keys)
Rinkeby testnet (to deploy the contract ) 



This is how it looks like

And there is a display of all our positions/deposits which we can withdraw anytime we want to.
